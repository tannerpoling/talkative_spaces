- basics working pretty clean
- next focus: animating volume response to movement, time based control in general
  - no movement -> max volume
    - max volume based on distance
  - movement -> quiet for a bit UNTIL movement stops, then slowly ramps up
    - need to define thresholds
  - assuming all of this happens in the same loop -> time based ramping depends on period between loops
    - TODO: determine good loop period / rate. how often can we check the distance sensor, send data to touchdesigner?
    - idea of trying to make it all scale with the period but that sounds like more effort than it's worth
      - ex: period of 0.1s, and we use an array of volumes to "animate" volume
        - a 3 second animation at 0.1s per cycle = 30 values to loop through
    - then get into thresholds, tracking, time data, etc
